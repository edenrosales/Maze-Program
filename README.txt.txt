It is explained through reading all the comments in the code, however I felt that I must also put something here. 
The program allows for 5 mice to be added and 10 cats. The cats can be manually placed wherever before the program 
starts, and they can have custom spawnpoints (also set before the game starts). The goal of the game is to get the
mice to the other side of the maze, finishing it with at leat ONE mouse survivng the maze. If all the mice die, it
is a game over.
